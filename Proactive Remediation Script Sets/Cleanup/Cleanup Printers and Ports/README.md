# Cleanup Printers and Ports

Removes printers and printer ports listed in the `Detect.ps1` and `Remediate.ps1` scripts.

## Pre-Requisites

The printer and ports lists in both the `Detect.ps1` and `Remediate.ps1` scripts must be modified to appropriately list those that need to be removed. Importantly, they must also match!

## Note

The `Remediate.ps1` script, depending on your configuration, can be run as a stand-alone script if desired.
