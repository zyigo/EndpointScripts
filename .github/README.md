  As a small business, we needed a way to manage devices quickly, simply and effectively. To do so, [ALARP-Solutions/EndpointScripts](https://github.com/ALARP-Solutions/EndpointScripts) was established. It is a collection of ideas, thoughts and scripts for effective configuration of Microsoft Endpoint Managed and Intune devices.
