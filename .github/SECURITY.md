## Reporting a Vulnerability

## Management Process
When we receives a security bug report we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected artefacts.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for artefacts still under maintenance.
4. Publish fixes as soon as possible to this repository.
